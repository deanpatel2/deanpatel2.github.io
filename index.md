Hello, this is your one stop shop to browse my various projects, profiles, and platforms. Use the links to get a better sense of what I can do!

### About Me

At present, I am a 4th year student at [Northeastern University](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/) in Boston, MA pursuing a BS in Computer Science & Economics.  Some of my past work include reducing and forecasting carbon emissions, streamlining and automating data flows, and mitigating noise within Fortune 500 corporate databases. Currently, I am honing my analytics and visualization skills via football (real football) analytics projects.


In the past, I worked as data automation analyst for a hydrogen fuel cell company and data science intern for an enterprise data management firm.

### Projects

- [DPStat](https://medium.com/@patel.dea): This is where I write my own football analytics reports. I use publicly available data as well as [my own collection methods](https://github.com/deanpatel2/FotMob-PL-Webscraper) to generate statistics and insights about the game.

- [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/deanpatel): My Kaggle profile, where I create and upload datasets to share ideas with the wider analytics community. I also use Kaggle for online courses and receive [certificates](certificates.md) upon completion.

### Work Experience

- [Nuvera](https://www.nuvera.com/): Here, I worked as a data automation analyst where I replaced the comapany's ageing data automation process with a streamlined desktop GUI application using Python.
- [GlobalIDs](https://www.globalids.com/): Here, I worked as a data science intern where I designed new data validation software to decipher anomalies in massive corporate datasets.

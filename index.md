### About Me

At present, I am a 4th year student at [Northeastern University](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/) in Boston, MA pursuing a BS in Computer Science & Economics.  Some of my past work include reducing and forecasting carbon emissions, streamlining and automating data flows, and mitigating noise within Fortune 500 corporate databases. Currently, I am honing my analytics and visualization skills via football (real football) analytics projects.

In the past, I worked as data automation analyst for a hydrogen fuel cell company and data science intern for an enterprise data management firm.

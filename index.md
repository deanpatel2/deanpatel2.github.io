### About Me

At present, I am a 4th year student at [Northeastern University](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/) in Boston, MA pursuing a BS in Computer Science & Economics.  Some of my past projects include reducing and forecasting carbon emissions, streamlining and automating data flows, and mitigating noise within Fortune 500 corporate databases. Currently, I am honing my analytics and visualization skills via football (real football) analytics projects.

In the past, I worked as data automation analyst for a hydrogen fuel cell company and data science intern for a data enterprise management firm.

### Work

- [DPStat](https://medium.com/@patel.dea): A place where I write my own football analytics reports. I use publicly available data as well as [my own collection methods](https://github.com/deanpatel2/FotMob-PL-Webscraper) to generate statistics and insights about the game.

- [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/deanpatel): My Kaggle profile, where I upload datasets I create to share with the rest of the analytics community. I also do online courses and receive [certificates](certificates.md).

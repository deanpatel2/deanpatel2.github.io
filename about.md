## About Me

---

At present, I am a 4th year CS student at [Northeastern University](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/) in Boston, MA. Data analytics, football (real football), and sustainable energy are my passions. I seek out opportunities that allow me to combine them.

My past work includes forecasting carbon emissions for my hometown (Princeton, NJ), streamlining data automation for hydrogen fuel cells, and developing algorithms for mitigating noise within Fortune 500 corporate databases. 

Currently, I am taking classes in Fall '21 and working as a Data Analyst for Northeastern's Venture Accelerator [IDEA](https://www.northeastern.edu/idea/). I also work on personal projects, such as [writing programs](https://github.com/deanpatel2) and [publishing articles](https://medium.com/@patel.dea) about football analytics. I do this because in addition to having full autonomy with my projects, I learn a lot from writing about my own work.

I am actively searching for co-ops and internships in the field of analytics, so if you would like to learn more about me, please reach out.

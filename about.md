## About Me

---

At present, I am a 4th year student at [Northeastern University](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/) in Boston, MA pursuing a BS in Computer Science & Economics. Data analytics, sustainable energy, economics, and football (real football) are my passions. I seek out opportunities that allow me to combine them.

My past work includes forecasting carbon emissions for my hometown, streamlining data flows for hydrogen fuel cells, and mitigating noise within Fortune 500 corporate databases. 

Currently, I am building tools and writing reports at the intersection of analytics and football. I do this because my curiosity for the sport allows me to generate my own unique questions and insights. 

Combining analytics with football allows me to approach data analysis with a curiosity-based attitude and accelerate the process of honing my statistical and visualization skills. I get to design my own projects, collect my own data, and now I wake up everyday looking forward to see what I can produce.

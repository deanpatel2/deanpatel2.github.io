## About Me

---

CS Student. Data analytics and football (real football) are my passions.

---

At present, I am a 4th year student at [Northeastern University](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/) in Boston, MA pursuing a BS in Computer Science & Economics. 

Some of my past work include reducing and forecasting carbon emissions, streamlining and automating data flows, and mitigating noise within Fortune 500 corporate databases. Currently, I am honing my analytics and visualization skills via football analytics projects.

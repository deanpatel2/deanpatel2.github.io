## About Me

---

I'm currently in my 4th year as a student at [Northeastern University](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/) based out of Boston, MA and Princeton, NJ. I am majoring in Computer Science and Economics. 

Data analytics, football (real football), and sustainable energy are my passions. I also have a budding interest in advanced NLP.

My past work includes forecasting carbon emissions for my hometown (Princeton, NJ), streamlining data automation for hydrogen fuel cells, and developing algorithms for mitigating noise within Fortune 500 corporate databases. 

I write about some of my personal projects [here](https://medium.com/@patel.dea). I do this because I learn more deeply when I write about my own work.

I am actively searching for co-ops and internships in the field of analytics, particularly at the intersection of big data and automation. If you would like to learn more about me, please reach out!

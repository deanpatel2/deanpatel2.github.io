## About Me

---

At present, I am a 4th year student at [Northeastern University](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/) in Boston, MA pursuing a BS in Computer Science & Economics. Data analytics, football (real football), sustainable energy, and economics are my passions. I seek out opportunities that allow me to combine them.

My past work includes forecasting carbon emissions for my hometown, streamlining data flows for hydrogen fuel cells, and developing algorithms for mitigating noise within Fortune 500 corporate databases. 

Currently, I am taking classes and working as a Data Analyst for Northeastern's Venture Accelerator [IDEA](https://www.northeastern.edu/idea/). I also [write programs](https://github.com/deanpatel2) and [publish articles](https://medium.com/@patel.dea) to Medium about football analytics (applying data science to football data). 

Combining analytics with football has allowed me to approach analytics with more curiosity and accelerated the process of honing my statistical and visualization skills. I get to design my own projects, collect my own data, and write about my own work. 

If you would like to learn more about me, please reach out.

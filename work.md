### IDEA
#### Data Analyst
#### *September 2021 - Present*

### GlobalIDs
#### Data Science Intern
#### *July 2020 - May 2021*

[GlobalIDs](https://www.globalids.com/) is an enterprise data management firm managing large corporate databases including Fortune 500 companies.

**The mission**: Use NLP techniques to deterministically decipher noise values in any single column of unlabeled categorical data. After this, scale to multi-column and identify noise that exists between semantically-related columns without an "authoritative" reference set.

Accomplishments/responsibilities:

- Created a new data validation algorithm using NLP techniques to decipher anomalies in columnar datasets, which was deployed to client software within 3 months
- Managed deliverables for a team of 6 interns and communicated progress with other teams across the 100+ person company, working with both managers and coders
- Developed a multi-columnar noise detection model that identifies anomalies between related values at the row-level of datasets
  - E.g. If a city and zip were both valid in their own right, but did not match semantically (i.e. 02110 and New York City), we wanted to identify that as noise  

>GlobalIDs gave me a taste of project management along with the opportunity to grapple with cutting-edge data science problems where scalability was paramount.

### Nuvera
#### Data Automation Co-op
#### *January 2020 - May 2020*

[Nuvera](https://www.nuvera.com/) is a manufacturer of zero-emissions hydrogen fuel cells and engines.

Accomplishments/responsibilities:

- Replaced the comapany's ageing data automation process with a streamlined desktop GUI application using Python
- Application was deployed to every test engineer's desktop and became the hub for all data automation and analysis tasks
- Adressed complicated data lineage and version control issues rooted in an array of buggy VBA macros by standardizing programming language to Python
- Introduced logistic regression model to predict probability of stack failure in the field

>Nuvera gave me the opportunity to champion a full-cycle project from early stage to final deployment and a taste of how to address long-standing data issues within a company.

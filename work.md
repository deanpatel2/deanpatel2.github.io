## Work Experience

---

### IDEA
#### Data Analyst
#### *September 2021 - Present*

[IDEA](https://www.northeastern.edu/idea/) is Northeastern's student-led venture accelerator.

Specifics currently unknown as I recently began this role. In general, my main responsibilities include:

- Assisting in web integration of analytical insights and visualizations.
- Creating data dashboarding visualization of key insights to be listed on a new website for the organization
- Initiating sentiment analysis on textual feedback from venture surveys

### GlobalIDs
#### Data Science Intern
#### *July 2020 - May 2021*

[GlobalIDs](https://www.globalids.com/) is an enterprise data management firm managing large corporate databases including Fortune 500 companies.

**Overarching questions**:
- *How can we decipher noise in columnar data without knowing its semantics/label (at scale and deterministically)?*
- **More important**: *How can we scale that to remove noise from an entire dataset/database, using only the data itself?*

Accomplishments/responsibilities:

- Created a new data validation algorithm using NLP techniques to decipher anomalies in columnar datasets, which was deployed to client software within 3 months
- Managed deliverables for a team of 6 interns and communicated progress with other teams across the 100+ person company, working with both managers and coders
- Developed a multi-columnar noise detection model that identifies anomalies between related values at the row-level of datasets
  - E.g. If a city and zip were both valid in their own right, but did not match semantically (i.e. 02110 and New York City), we wanted to identify that as noise  

>GlobalIDs gave me a taste of project management along with the opportunity to grapple with senior-level data science problems on the cutting-edge where scalability was paramount.

### Nuvera
#### Data Analysis Co-op
#### *January 2020 - May 2020*

[Nuvera](https://www.nuvera.com/) is a manufacturer of zero-emissions hydrogen fuel cells and engines.

**Essential task**: *Build an application that serves as a "hub" for data automation processes, enhancing existing visualizations and adding new ones.*

Accomplishments/responsibilities:

- Replaced the comapany's ageing data automation process with a streamlined desktop GUI application using Python
- Application was deployed to every test engineer's desktop and became the hub for all data automation and analysis tasks
- Adressed complicated data lineage and version control issues rooted in an array of buggy VBA macros by standardizing programming language to Python
- Introduced logistic regression model to predict probability of stack failure in the field

>Nuvera gave me the opportunity to champion a full-cycle project from early stage to final deployment and a taste of how to address long-standing data issues within a company.

### Sustainable Princeton
#### Carbon Emissions Analyst
#### *April 2019 - July 2019*

[Sustainable Princeton](https://www.sustainableprinceton.org/), is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit whose mission is to lead community change to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and strengthen climate resilience.

**Essential task**: *Quantify and contextualize transportation emissions in Princeton, and provide figures to advise on the most effective options in addressing it.* 

Accomplishments/responsibilities:

- Quantified the emissions benefits of various green policies for a team of strategists lead by Princeton professors and local experts
- Provided key transportation figures in the development of Princeton's 30-year Climate Action Plan and its presentation to the municipality in July 2019
  - E.g. estimated commuter incentive program emissions reduction to be appx. 1062 metric tons of CO2, determined transportation as a sector comprises appx. 30% of all Princeton emissions in 2018
- See the report [here](https://www.sustainableprinceton.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/princeton-climate-action-plan-report.pdf)
  - Figures I worked on can be found between pages 26-34 

>With Sustainable Princeton, I was able to combine my passions for analytics and sustainability while also contributing to a charitable cause and making meaninful connections with people in my community.

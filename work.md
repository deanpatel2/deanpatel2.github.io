## GlobalIDs
### Data Science Intern
#### *July 2020 - May 2021*

[GlobalIDs](https://www.globalids.com/) is an enterprise data management firm managing large corporate databases including Fortune 500 companies.

**The project**: Use NLP techniques to deterministically decipher noise values in any single column of unlabeled categorical data. After this, scale to multi-column and identify noise that exists between semantically-related columns without an "authoritative" reference set.

Accomplishments/responsibilities:

- Created a new data validation algorithm using NLP techniques to decipher anomalies in columnar datasets, which was deployed to client software within 3 months
- Managed deliverables for a team of 6 interns and communicated progress with other teams across the 100+ person company, working with both managers and coders
- Developed a multi-columnar noise detection model that identifies anomalies between related values at the row-level of datasets
  - E.g. If a city and zip were both valid in their own right, but did not match semantically (i.e. 02110 and New York City), we wanted to identify that as noise  

>GlobalIDs gave me a glimpse into project management as well as the opportunity to work on cutting-edge data science projects for high-profile clients.

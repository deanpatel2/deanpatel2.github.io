## Work Experience

---

### GlobalIDs
#### Data Science Intern
#### July 2020 - May 2021

[GlobalIDs](https://www.globalids.com/) is an enterprise data management firm managing large corporate databases including Fortune 500 companies'.

Here, I worked as a data science intern where I designed new data validation software to decipher anomalies in massive categorical datasets. 

Most of the details are confidential, but some of the main topics I engaged with are: *clustering, NLP, Bayesian statistics, outlier detection methods, correlation tests*.

As a senior member of the team of 6 interns, I also managed deliverables and communicated progress and results with other teams across the 50+ person company, working with both managers and coders. 

>GlobalIDs gave me a taste of project management along with an unparalleled exposure to solving real world data science problems where scalability was paramount.

### Nuvera
#### Data Analysis Co-op
#### January 2020 - May 2020

[Nuvera](https://www.nuvera.com/) is a manufacturer of zero-emissions hydrogen fuel cells and engines. 

Here, I worked in the Testing department as a data analyst where I replaced the comapany's ageing automation process with a streamlined desktop GUI application using Python.

Nuvera had previously used an array of VBA macros to process test data from various sources, complicating lineage, version control, and automation. I addresses these issues by building a single, all-inclusive application which was deployed to every engineer's desktop where all data automation and analysis could be performed.

>Nuvera gave me the opportunity to champion a project from early stage to final deployment and a taste of how to address long-standing data issues within a company.

### Sustainable Princeton
#### Carbon Emissions Analyst
#### April 2019 - July 2019

At [Sustainable Princeton](https://www.sustainableprinceton.org/), the motto is "climate change is a global issue, but change must begin locally".

I bought into their vision and quantified the emissions benefits of various green policies for a team of strategists.

I was particularly focused on transportation emissions. This included meeting with local transportation experts, collecting data, outlining methodology, and ultimately forecasting how much we could reduce emissions through commuter incentives and a shared electric bike infrastructure.

>With Sustainable Princeton, I was able to combine my passions for analytics and sustainability while also contributing to a charitable cause.

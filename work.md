## GlobalIDs
#### Data Science Intern
#### July 2020 - May 2021

[GlobalIDs](https://www.globalids.com/) is an enterprise data management firm performing data quality, classification, lineage, and other services for large corporate databases including Fortune 500 companies.

Here, I worked as a data science intern where I designed new data validation **software to decipher anomalies** in massive corporate datasets. 

Most of the details are confidential, but some of the main topics I engaged with are: *clustering, NLP, Bayesian statistics, outlier detection methods, correlation tests*.

As a senior member of the team of 6 interns, I also managed deliverables and communicated progress and results with other teams across the 50+ person company, working with both managers and coders. 

>GlobalIDs gave me a taste of project management along with an unparalleled exposure to solving real world data science problems faced by international corporations.

## Nuvera
#### Data Analysis Co-op
#### January 2020 - May 2020

[Nuvera](https://www.nuvera.com/) is a manufacturer of zero-emissions hydrogen fuel cells and engines. 

Here, I worked in the Testing department as a data analyst where I replaced the comapany's ageing automation process with a streamlined desktop GUI application using Python.

Nuvera had previously used an array of VBA macros to process test data from various sources, complicating lineage, version control, and automation. I addresses these issues by building a single, all-inclusive application which was deployed to every engineer's desktop where all data automation and analysis could be performed.

>Nuvera gave me the freedom to champion a project from early stage to final deployment and learn how to address long-standing data issues within a company.

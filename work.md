## GlobalIDs
#### July 2020 - May 2021

[GlobalIDs](https://www.globalids.com/) is an enterprise data management firm performing data quality, classification, lineage, and other services for large corporate databases including Fortune 500 companies.

Here, I worked as a data science intern where I designed new data validation **software to decipher anomalies** in massive corporate datasets. 

Most of the details are confidential but some of the topics I engaged with are: clustering, NLP, Bayesian statistics, outlier detection methods, correlation tests.

As a senior member of the team of 6 interns, I also managed deliverables and communicated progress and results with other teams across the 50+ person company, working with both managers and coders. 

My experience here gave me a taste of project management along with an unparalleled exposure to solving real world data science problems faced by international corporations.

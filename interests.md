## Interests & Hobbies

---


### Data Analytics

I got into analytics because there are such low barriers to entry. All you need is a curious mind and data. As a curious person who likes numbers and has lots of various passions, analytics became my way of expressing my personality through the questions and insights I generate.

### Football (real football)

I grew up with the nickname ["Dean the soccer machine"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXh5QmqUBp4). Many of my idols and role models are from the football world-- Arsene Wenger, Fernando Torres, and Mesut Ozil to name a few. Football is almost certainly my greatest passion and I consider it part of my identity as well. It remains a dream of mine to work in some sort of analytics capacity for a Premier League club (hopefully the club I support, Arsenal).

### Languages

I take an active interest in learning about the world, from history and geography to food and culture. Many of my global experiences, particularly in my study abroads, have been massively enhanced by speaking multiple languages. It is fascinating to me how much more we can learn about other cultures through language alone. Currently, I can speak French at an advanced level, German at a conversational level, and Japanese/Spanish at a novice level.

### Calisthenics

Calisthenics is strength training where you use your own bodyweight. I like it because I get bored of regular weightlifting and there are many cool movements you can train your body to do with bars alone. Plus, it is a very friendly community where everyone wants to help each other out.

### Projects

There are 3 parts to my data science projects: the data, the code, and the article.

Code:

I use publicly available data as well as [my own collection methods](https://github.com/deanpatel2/FotMob-PL-Webscraper) to generate statistics and insights about the game. My first reports are currently in their final stages before publishing...

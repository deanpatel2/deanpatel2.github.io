### Projects

- [DPStat](https://medium.com/@patel.dea): This is where I write my own football analytics reports. I use publicly available data as well as [my own collection methods](https://github.com/deanpatel2/FotMob-PL-Webscraper) to generate statistics and insights about the game.

- [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/deanpatel): This is my Kaggle profile, where I create and upload datasets to share ideas with the wider analytics community. I also use Kaggle for online courses and receive [certificates](certificates.md) upon completion.
